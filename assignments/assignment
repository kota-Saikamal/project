and a server can be classified into 2 types they are physical servers and virtual servers 
=> Physical Servers: they build and managed physically within the data center of their respective organization
=> Virtual Servers: they are not physical managed instead they create hardware component as a software they is also known as infrasture as code.

2) What are Virtual Machines or VM's ? 

Virtual Machines is a software-based computers that runs on operating system just like physical computer but managed by the hypervisors and also share underlining hardware with other VM's
VM's are also classified into two kinds
=> System VM's: they are fulled virtualized operating system (Ex: EC2 in aws)
=> Application VM's or Process VM's: used for one specific task or process ( Ex: JVM for running java programs)

3) What are Hypervisors ?

A Hypervisor are used to manage VM's where it create sufficient resources for each VM and also isolated each VM with a separate operating system
There are two types of hypervisor
=> Bare metal: runs directly on the hardware ( faster , used in cloud computing)
=> Hosted: run inside the operating system (easier , used for testing)
