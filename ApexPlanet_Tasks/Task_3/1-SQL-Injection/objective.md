# SQL Injection – Objective

The objective of this task is to identify and exploit an SQL Injection
vulnerability in DVWA in order to:

- Bypass authentication
- Enumerate the backend database
- Extract sensitive data (usernames and password hashes)
- Understand how improper input validation leads to SQL Injection

This attack is performed in a controlled lab environment (DVWA on Kali Linux).
