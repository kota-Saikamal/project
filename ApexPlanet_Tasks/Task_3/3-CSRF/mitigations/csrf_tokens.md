# CSRF Mitigation – CSRF Tokens

## Description
A CSRF token is a unique, unpredictable value generated by the server and associated with the user session.

## How It Works
1. Server generates a token.
2. Token is embedded in forms or requests.
3. Server validates the token on request submission.

## Security Benefit
- Prevents forged requests
- Ensures request origin authenticity
- Stops CSRF attacks even with valid sessions
