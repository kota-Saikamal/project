# Privilege Level Analysis

## Overview
During the exploitation phase, a critical vulnerability was identified in the FTP service running **vsftpd version 2.3.4**. This version is known to contain a malicious backdoor that allows remote command execution.

## Vulnerability Details
- Service: FTP
- Port: 21/TCP
- Version: vsftpd 2.3.4
- CVE: CVE-2011-2523
- Severity: Critical

The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted username containing the sequence `:)` is used during authentication. This action causes the service to open a hidden backdoor listener on port **6200**, which allows remote shell access.

## Exploitation Method
Instead of manually triggering the backdoor, the **Metasploit Framework** was used to automate the exploitation process.

Steps performed:
1. Identified vulnerable service via Nmap enumeration.
2. Located appropriate Metasploit module (`exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`).
3. Configured target parameters.
4. Executed exploit to obtain shell access.

## Privilege Level Achieved
After successful exploitation:

- Access Type: Command shell
- User: root
- Privilege Level: Full administrative/root access

Verification commands:
id
whoami


Output confirmed root privileges.

## Impact Assessment
- Remote attacker gains unauthorized root-level access.
- Full system compromise possible.
- Ability to read sensitive files (including `/etc/shadow`).
- Potential lateral movement within network.

## Conclusion
The presence of vsftpd 2.3.4 introduces a critical security risk due to its embedded backdoor functionality. Exploitation via Metasploit successfully demonstrated full system compromise with root privileges.
