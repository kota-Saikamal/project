# Metasploit Exploitation – Metasploitable2

## Overview
This repository documents a **structured penetration testing workflow** focused on
**exploitation and post-exploitation using the Metasploit Framework** against
**Metasploitable2**, an intentionally vulnerable Linux VM used for security training.

The goal is to demonstrate **methodology, tooling, and documentation quality** —
not just exploitation.

---

## Scope
- Target: Metasploitable2 (Lab Environment)
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Focus Area: Exploitation & Post-Exploitation
- Tools: Nmap, Metasploit Framework

⚠️ **All activities are performed in an isolated lab environment for educational purposes only.**

Each directory represents a **distinct penetration testing phase**, aligned with
industry methodologies such as **OWASP WSTG** and **PTES**.

---

## Methodology
1. Reconnaissance & Service Enumeration  
2. Vulnerability Identification  
3. Exploit Selection & Execution  
4. Post-Exploitation Validation  
5. Impact Analysis  
6. Remediation Recommendations  

---

## Key Objectives
- Identify vulnerable services and versions
- Exploit a known vulnerability using Metasploit
- Obtain a reverse shell
- Perform post-exploitation validation (`sysinfo`, `hashdump`)
- Document impact and remediation clearly

---

## Ethical Notice
This project is strictly for **learning and demonstration purposes**.
No real-world systems were tested or harmed.

> Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical.
