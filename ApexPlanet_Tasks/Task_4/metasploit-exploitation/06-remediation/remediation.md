# Remediation Recommendations

## Immediate Actions
- Remove or upgrade vsftpd version 2.3.4 immediately.
- Disable FTP service if not required.
- Close unauthorized open ports including port 6200.

## Patch Management
- Upgrade to a secure and supported FTP server version.
- Apply vendor security patches regularly.

## Configuration Hardening
- Disable anonymous FTP access.
- Restrict external access to FTP via firewall rules.
- Implement network segmentation.

## Monitoring and Detection
- Monitor login attempts and unusual port activity.
- Deploy intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- Enable centralized logging.

## Authentication Security
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
- Remove unused user accounts.

## Long-Term Security Improvements
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments.
- Implement secure software lifecycle practices.
- Replace legacy services with secure alternatives (e.g., SFTP/SSH).

## Conclusion
Proper patching, service hardening, and continuous monitoring are required to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities such as vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor attacks.
