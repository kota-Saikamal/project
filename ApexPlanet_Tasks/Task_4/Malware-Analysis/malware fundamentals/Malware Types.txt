Malware Types — Complete Overview

1. Virus
A virus is malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate files or programs and spreads when the infected file is executed. It usually requires user interaction to activate. Objectives include data corruption, system disruption, or spreading to other files.

Key Characteristics:
- Requires host file
- User-triggered execution
- File infection and modification
- Can replicate within system

Common Examples:
File infector viruses, macro viruses.

--------------------------------------------------

2. Worm
A worm is standalone malware that self-replicates and spreads automatically across networks without user interaction. It exploits vulnerabilities to propagate rapidly.

Key Characteristics:
- Self-spreading
- Network-based propagation
- No host file required
- Can cause network congestion or deploy payloads

Common Examples:
Conficker, WannaCry (worm-like propagation).

--------------------------------------------------

3. Trojan (Trojan Horse)
A trojan disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installing it. Unlike viruses or worms, it does not self-replicate but provides attackers access or executes malicious actions.

Key Characteristics:
- Social engineering based
- Appears legitimate
- Backdoor access creation
- Data theft or remote control

Common Examples:
Remote Access Trojans (RATs), banking trojans.

--------------------------------------------------

4. Ransomware
Ransomware encrypts files or locks systems and demands payment (ransom) to restore access. Often delivered through phishing, exploits, or malicious downloads.

Key Characteristics:
- File encryption
- Payment demand (crypto payments common)
- Data exfiltration sometimes included
- High operational impact

Common Types:
Crypto ransomware, locker ransomware.

--------------------------------------------------

5. Rootkit
A rootkit is designed to hide malware or attacker presence by modifying the operating system or system components, enabling stealthy persistence.

Key Characteristics:
- Stealth techniques
- Kernel or user-level operation
- Hides processes/files/network activity
- Persistence mechanisms

Types:
Kernel rootkits, bootkits, firmware rootkits.

--------------------------------------------------

6. Spyware
Spyware secretly collects information about users or systems and sends it to attackers. Focus is surveillance rather than immediate damage.

Key Characteristics:
- Data monitoring
- Keylogging
- Browser tracking
- Credential theft

Examples:
Keyloggers, tracking software.

--------------------------------------------------

7. Adware
Adware displays unwanted advertisements and may track browsing behavior. Some variants are borderline legitimate, others malicious.

Key Characteristics:
- Pop-up ads
- Browser redirection
- Tracking user activity
- May degrade performance

--------------------------------------------------

Summary:
These are malware categories describing behavior and intent, not specific file formats. Malware can exist as executables, scripts, documents with macros, libraries, or other program types depending on delivery and execution method.
