# Phishing Simulation Methodology

## 1. Introduction

This methodology outlines the structured approach used to design and execute a phishing awareness simulation within a controlled cybersecurity training environment.

The process follows a simplified penetration testing workflow adapted for social engineering simulations.

---

## 2. Methodology Phases

### Phase 1 — Planning and Scope Definition

Objectives:

- Define educational goals.
- Restrict scope to simulation only.
- Avoid real-world exploitation.

Actions:

- Determine phishing scenario.
- Create fake login interface.
- Define awareness training outcomes.

---

### Phase 2 — Design

Goals:

- Replicate common phishing characteristics.

Design Elements:

- Urgent account verification message.
- Fake credential form.
- Psychological triggers (fear, urgency).

Security Control:

- No backend credential storage.

---

### Phase 3 — Development

Implementation:

- Static HTML pages.
- CSS styling for realistic appearance.
- JavaScript to simulate interaction.

Files:

- index.html
- awareness.html
- style.css
- script.js

---

### Phase 4 — Simulation Execution

Process:

1. User visits phishing simulation page.
2. User interacts with login form.
3. Simulation alert explains phishing concept.
4. User directed to awareness training page.

---

### Phase 5 — Awareness Training

Training Content:

- Phishing indicators.
- URL inspection.
- Verification techniques.
- Security best practices.

Goal:

- Convert offensive demonstration into defensive knowledge.

---

### Phase 6 — Documentation and Reporting

Deliverables:

- Simulation report.
- Methodology documentation.
- Screenshots and analysis.

---

## 3. Ethical Guidelines

- Educational simulation only.
- No real phishing deployment.
- No credential harvesting.
- Transparency with participants.

---

## 4. Expected Learning Outcomes

- Understand phishing attack structure.
- Identify social engineering techniques.
- Apply phishing detection strategies.
- Improve cybersecurity awareness.

---

## 5. Conclusion

This methodology integrates offensive simulation with defensive education, providing a balanced approach to social engineering awareness training.
