# Social Engineering Simulation (Phishing Awareness Project)

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a **phishing simulation** designed for cybersecurity awareness training and educational purposes only. The goal is to help users understand how phishing attacks work and how to identify common indicators of malicious intent.

This is a **controlled simulation** and must NOT be used for real phishing attacks or illegal activities.

## Objectives

- Simulate a phishing webpage in a safe lab environment.
- Demonstrate common social engineering techniques.
- Provide awareness training for phishing detection.
- Educate users on identifying suspicious elements.

---

## Features

- Educational phishing login simulation.
- Awareness training page explaining phishing indicators.
- Client-side only simulation (no credential storage).
- Visual demonstration of phishing red flags.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Launch `index.html` in a web browser.

Optional (Local Server):

python3 -m http.server
Then open:
http://localhost:8000

## Simulation Rules

- Do NOT collect real credentials.
- Do NOT deploy publicly.
- Use only in lab or training environments.
- Clearly inform participants this is a simulation.
