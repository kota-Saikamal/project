# Methodology

## Project Methodology

1. Planning Phase
   - Define objectives, scope, and ethical guidelines.
   - Identify phishing scenario and target awareness goals.
   - Perform basic threat modeling for simulation design.

2. Campaign Design
   - Create phishing email templates.
   - Design and develop simulated landing pages.
   - Configure tracking parameters for user interaction metrics.

3. Infrastructure Setup
   - Configure domain/subdomain for simulation.
   - Setup SMTP service for email delivery.
   - Deploy phishing simulation platform (e.g., GoPhish).

4. Simulation Execution
   - Launch controlled phishing campaign.
   - Monitor campaign status and ensure ethical compliance.

5. Monitoring and Analysis
   - Collect data on email opens, clicks, and submissions.
   - Analyze behavior patterns and identify trends.

6. Incident Response Simulation
   - Detect simulated phishing indicators.
   - Document containment and remediation procedures.

7. Reporting
   - Compile findings, screenshots, and evidence.
   - Provide mitigation strategies and awareness recommendations.
   - Prepare professional final report documentation.
