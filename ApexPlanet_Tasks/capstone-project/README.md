# Security Awareness Phishing Simulation

## Overview
This project is a controlled phishing simulation developed as part of a cybersecurity capstone assignment during the ApexPlanet Virtual Internship. The objective is to simulate phishing scenarios in a safe environment to evaluate user awareness, analyze behavior, and recommend security improvements.

## Objectives
- Design a phishing simulation campaign
- Demonstrate phishing attack workflow in a controlled environment
- Analyze user interaction metrics
- Document findings and mitigation strategies
- Improve organizational security awareness
