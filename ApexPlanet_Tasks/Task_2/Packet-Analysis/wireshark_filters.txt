Wireshark Display Filters Used During Network Traffic Analysis

1) HTTP Traffic Filter
   Filter:
     http
   Purpose:
     To isolate and analyze unencrypted HTTP requests and responses.
   Observations:
     - Captured HTTP GET and HEAD requests.
     - Observed HTTP 200 OK responses with headers.
     - Verified stateless client–server communication.

2) FTP Control Channel Filter
   Filter:
     ftp || tcp.port == 21
   Purpose:
     To capture FTP control traffic including authentication and commands.
   Observations:
     - USER and PASS commands transmitted in plaintext.
     - FTP commands such as LIST, RETR, and STOR observed.
     - Demonstrates insecurity of unencrypted FTP.

3) FTP Data Channel Filter
   Filter:
     ftp-data
   Purpose:
     To analyze the FTP data channel where file contents are transferred.
   Observations:
     - File transfer initiated in binary mode.
     - Actual file payload transmitted over a separate TCP connection.
     - File content extracted using Wireshark FTP object export.

4) DNS Traffic Filter
   Filter:
     dns
   Purpose:
     To isolate domain name resolution traffic.
   Observations:
     - Standard DNS query and response packets captured.
     - Verified mapping of domain names to IP addresses.

5) SYN Flood Detection Filter
   Filter:
     tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
   Purpose:
     To detect abnormal TCP SYN packet rates during SYN flood simulation.
   Observations:
     - Large number of SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.
     - Indicates half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
